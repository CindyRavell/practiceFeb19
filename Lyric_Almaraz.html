    <h1>Lyrics Song</h1>

    <p>
        I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface<br>
Don't know what you're expecting of me<br>
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes<br>

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow<br>
Every step that I take is another mistake to you<br>
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow<br>

I've become so numb<br>
I can't feel you there<br>
Become so tired<br>
So much more aware<br>

I'm becoming this<br>
All I want to do<br>
Is be more like me<br>
And be less like you<br>

Can't you see that you're smothering me?<br>
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control<br>
'Cause everything that you thought I would be<br>
Has fallen apart right in front of you<br>

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow<br>
Every step that I take is another mistake to you<br>
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow<br>
And every second I waste is more than I can take<br>

I've become so numb<br>
I can't feel you there<br>
Become so tired<br>
So much more aware<br>

I'm becoming this<br>
All I want to do<br>
Is be more like me<br>
And be less like you<br>

And I know<br>
I may end up failing, too<br>
But I know you were just like me<br>
With someone disappointed in you<br>

I've become so numb<br>
I can't feel you there<br>
Become so tired<br>
So much more aware<br>

I'm becoming this<br>
All I want to do<br>
Is be more like me<br>
And be less like you<br>

I've become so numb<br>
I can't feel you there<br>
I'm tired of being what you want me to be<br>

I've become so numb<br>
I can't feel you there<br>
I'm tired of being what you want me to be<br>
    </p>
